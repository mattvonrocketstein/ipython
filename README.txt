IPython README
==============

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation can be found in the ``docs/dist``
subdirectory in ``.html`` and ``.pdf`` formats, also available online at our
`website <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_.  The ``docs/source`` directory contains
the plaintext version of these manuals.


Instant running and testing
===========================

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   python ipython.py

and similarly, you can execute the built-in test suite with:
   
.. code-block:: bash

   python iptest.py
