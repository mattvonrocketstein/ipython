IPython README
==============

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation can be found in the ``docs/dist``
subdirectory in ``.html`` and ``.pdf`` formats, also available online at our
`website <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_.  The ``docs/source`` directory contains
the plaintext version of these manuals.


Dependencies and supported Python versions
==========================================

For full details, see the installation section of the manual.  The basic parts
of IPython only need the Python standard library, but much of its more advanced
functionality requires extra packages.

Officially, IPython requires Python version 2.5 or 2.6.  We have *not* yet
started to port IPython to Python 3.0.

.. warning::

    IPython 0.10 has only been well tested with Python 2.5 and 2.6.  Parts of
    it may work with Python 2.4, but we do not officially support Python 2.4
    anymore.  If you need to use 2.4, you can still run IPython 0.9.

    
Instant running
===============

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   python ipython.py
