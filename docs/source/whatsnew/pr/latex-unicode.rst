Typing unicode identifiers
--------------------------

.. image:: /_images/unicode_completion.png

Complex expressions can be much cleaner when written with a wider choice of
characters. Python 3 allows unicode identifiers, and IPython 3 makes it easier
to type those, using a feature from Julia. Type a backslash followed by a LaTeX
style short name, such as ``\alpha``. Press tab, and it will turn into Î±.
