.. Developers should add in this file, during each release cycle, information
.. about important changes they've made, in a summary format that's meant for
.. end users.  For each release we normally have three sections: features,  bug
.. fixes and api breakage.
.. Please remember to credit the authors of the contributions by name,
.. especially when they are new users or developers who do not regularly
.. participate  in IPython's development.
