================================================
Development version
================================================

Main `ipython` branch
=====================

New features
------------

* Added a new module :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook` to manage the integration
  with GUI event loops using `PyOS_InputHook`.  See the docstrings in this
  module or the main IPython docs for details.
* For users, GUI event loop integration is now handled through the new
  :command:`%gui` magic command.  Type ``%gui?`` at an IPython prompt for
  documentation.
* For developers :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook` provides a simple interface
  for managing the event loops in their interactive GUI applications.
  Examples can be found in our :file:`docs/examples/lib` directory.

Bug fixes
---------

* Keyboard interrupts now work with GUI support enabled across all platforms
  and all GUI toolkits reliably.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* Support for ``qt3`` has been dropped.  User's who need this should use
  previous versions of IPython.
* Removed :mod:`shellglobals` as it was obsolete. 
* Removed all the threaded shells in :mod:`IPython.core.shell`. These are no
  longer needed because of the new capabilities in
  :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook`.
* The old threading command line flags (pylab/wthread/etc.) have been
  deprecated.  Use :mod:`IPython.inputhook` or the new :command:`%gui` magic
  command instead.
* New top-level sub-packages have been created: :mod:`IPython.core`, 
  :mod:`IPython.lib`, :mod:`IPython.utils`, :mod:`IPython.deathrow`,
  :mod:`IPython.quarantine`.  All existing top-level modules have been
  moved to appropriate sub-packages.  All internal import statements
  have been updated and tests have been added.  The build system (setup.py
  and friends) have been updated.
* Compatability modules have been created for :mod:`IPython.Shell`, 
  :mod:`IPython.ipapi` and :mod:`IPython.iplib` that display warnings
  and then load the actual implementation from :mod:`IPython.core`.
* :mod:`Extensions` has been moved to :mod:`extensions`.
