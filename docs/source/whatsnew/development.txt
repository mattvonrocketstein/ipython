This document describes in-flight development work.

Redesigned IPython notebook user interface
------------------------------------------

(Add description & screenshots of the many changes to the notebook)

Cell magics
-----------

IPython's ``%magic`` functions have been extended to let you change the meaning
of a whole cell using the first line. For example, to time the execution of
several statements::

    %%timeit x = 0   # setup
    for i in range(100000):
        x += i**2

This is particularly useful to integrate code in another language, and cell
magics already exist for shell scripts, Cython, R and Octave. Using ``%%script
/usr/bin/foo``, you can run a cell in any interpreter that accepts code via
stdin.

Another handy cell magic makes it easy to write short text files: ``%%file
~/save/to/here.txt``.

To allow these features, the API for magic functions has been refactored and
made more powerful (:ghpull:`1732`).

Interactive tab completion for the Qt console
---------------------------------------------

(Add description & screenshots) (:ghpull:`1851`)

Other new features
------------------

* **%install_ext**: A new magic function to install an IPython extension from
  a URL. E.g. ``%install_ext
  https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics/raw/default/physics.py``.

* The ``%loadpy`` magic is no longer restricted to Python files, and has been
  renamed ``%load``. The old name remains as an alias.

* New command line arguments will help external programs find IPython folders:
  ``ipython locate`` finds the user's IPython directory, and ``ipython locate
  profile foo`` finds the folder for the 'foo' profile (if it exists).

* The :envvar:`IPYTHON_DIR` environment variable, introduced in the Great
  Reorganization of 0.11 and existing only in versions 0.11-0.13, has been
  deprecated. As described in :ghissue:`1167`, the complexity and confusion of
  migrating to this variable is not worth the aesthetic improvement. Please use
  the historical :envvar:`IPYTHONDIR` environment variable instead.

* The default value of *interactivity* passed from
  :meth:`~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_cell` to
  :meth:`~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_ast_nodes`
  is now configurable.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* The exception :exc:`IPython.core.error.TryNext` previously accepted
  arguments and keyword arguments to be passed to the next implementation
  of the hook. This feature was removed as it made error message propagation
  difficult and violated the principle of loose coupling.
